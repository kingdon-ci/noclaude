# Claude Code vs. Continue.dev Comparison

## Overview

This document compares Claude Code and Continue.dev for use in ANSI's code assistance workflows. The comparison is based on available information and current evaluation status.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature                     | Claude Code                                   | Continue.dev                               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Integration with ANSI API   | Yes, via custom proxy                         | Yes, official support                     |
| Interface                   | CLI                                           | IDE Extension                             |
| Usage Monitoring            | Yes, via Claude Code Monitor                  | Unknown, further research needed          |
| Pre-hook Feature            | Yes, but requires additional services         | Unknown, further research needed          |
| Licensing                   | Requires careful evaluation for ANSI use      | Presumably cleared for ANSI use           |
| Custom LLM Integration      | Possible with modifications                   | Unknown, further research needed          |

## Pros and Cons

### Claude Code

Pros:
- Familiar CLI interface for some developers
- Usage monitoring through Claude Code Monitor
- Potential for advanced features like Pre-hook (with additional services)
- Flexibility for custom integrations

Cons:
- Licensing concerns for ANSI use
- Requires custom proxy setup
- Some advanced features need additional, unapproved services

### Continue.dev

Pros:
- Official support for ANSI use
- Direct integration with IDEs
- Presumably cleared for ANSI's legal and security requirements

Cons:
- Usage monitoring capabilities unclear
- Potential limitations in customization compared to Claude Code

## Key Considerations

1. **Licensing and Approval**: Continue.dev appears to have an advantage in terms of official approval for ANSI use. Claude Code would require careful evaluation and potential special licensing arrangements.

2. **Usage Monitoring**: Claude Code offers clear usage tracking via Claude Code Monitor. Continue.dev's capabilities in this area are unknown and require further investigation.

3. **Integration**: Both tools can integrate with the ANSI-provided API, but Continue.dev likely has a more streamlined setup process.

4. **Advanced Features**: Claude Code's potential for features like Pre-hook could be advantageous, but implementation may be limited by approval for additional services.

5. **Customization**: Claude Code seems to offer more flexibility for custom integrations, which could be beneficial for specific ANSI use cases.

## Areas Needing Further Research

1. Continue.dev's usage monitoring capabilities
2. Availability of advanced features in Continue.dev comparable to Claude Code's Pre-hook
3. Ease of custom LLM integration in Continue.dev
4. Performance comparisons in ANSI-specific workflows

## Conclusion

Both Claude Code and Continue.dev have their strengths for ANSI GSFC's use case. Continue.dev has the advantage of official support and presumed clearance for ANSI use, making it a safer choice from a compliance perspective. However, Claude Code offers some advanced features and clear usage monitoring that may be beneficial.

The decision between the two may ultimately depend on:
1. The importance of advanced features and customization
2. The ease of obtaining proper approval for Claude Code
3. The results of further investigation into Continue.dev's capabilities

A thorough evaluation of both tools in ANSI-specific workflows, along with clarification on Continue.dev's features, would be necessary for a definitive recommendation.
