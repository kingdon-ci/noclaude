## Overview of FISMA LOW

FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) Low baseline applies to information systems that handle data where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, assets, or individuals.

### High-Level Control Categories for FISMA LOW

1. **Access Control**
   - Limit system access to authorized users.
   - Enforce least privilege and separation of duties.

2. **Audit and Accountability**
   - Generate audit records for security-relevant events.
   - Regular review of audit logs.

3. **Identification and Authentication**
   - Use identification and authentication mechanisms (e.g., passwords).
   - Ensure user identity proofing.

4. **System and Communications Protection**
   - Protect data in transit.
   - Monitor and control communications at system boundaries.

5. **Risk Assessment**
   - Conduct risk assessments at predetermined intervals.
   - Address identified risks with mitigation strategies.

6. **Configuration Management**
   - Establish baseline configurations.
   - Manage changes to system configurations.

7. **System and Information Integrity**
   - Detect and respond to system flaws.
   - Update system components to fix vulnerabilities.

8. **Contingency Planning**
   - Develop and test contingency plans.
   - Ensure system recoverability.

9. **Awareness and Training**
   - Provide security training.
   - Promote security awareness.

10. **Physical and Environmental Protection**
    - Control physical access to systems.
    - Protect equipment from environmental hazards.

This document summarizes the core control areas that organizations need to address for systems assessed at the FISMA Low impact level.

## Overview of FISMA MODERATE

FISMA Moderate baseline applies to information systems handling data where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, assets, or individuals.

### Additional Control Categories for FISMA Moderate

1. **System and Communications Protection**
   - Enhanced monitoring and control of system boundaries.
   - More rigorous encryption and data protection.

2. **Identification and Authentication**
   - Multi-factor authentication requirements.
   - Stronger identity proofing and credential management.

3. **Incident Response**
   - Established processes for timely incident detection and handling.
   - Regular incident response testing and updates.

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - More frequent and comprehensive risk assessments.
   - Incorporation of threat intelligence and advanced metrics.

5. **System and Information Integrity**
   - Automated tools for vulnerability scanning and patch management.
   - Continuous monitoring for integrity violations.

These additional controls build on the FISMA Low baseline to address heightened threats and vulnerabilities for moderate impact systems.
