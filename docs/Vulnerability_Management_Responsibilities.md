# Vulnerability Management Responsibilities Document

## NASA Responsibility

NASA holds enterprise-wide accountability for vulnerability management to ensure consistent security posture across all systems.

1. **Provide enterprise vulnerability scanning tools and capabilities (CSAT)**
   - NASA supplies centralized tools for scanning vulnerabilities in IT assets to support organizational security monitoring.

2. **Establish vulnerability remediation timelines**
   - NASA defines deadlines for vulnerability fixes based on severity levels to prioritize and enforce timely remediation.

3. **Share vulnerability intelligence across the organization**
   - NASA disseminates threat and vulnerability information to relevant teams to enable proactive risk mitigation.

4. **Define scanning requirements and frequencies**
   - NASA sets standards on how often assets must be scanned and what scope the scans should cover to maintain thorough coverage.

5. **Maintain centralized vulnerability management systems**
   - NASA operates core systems for tracking vulnerabilities, remediation status, and reporting to maintain enterprise-wide visibility.

## AWS/Azure Responsibility

Cloud providers share responsibility for infrastructure security vulnerabilities they control.

1. **Conduct vulnerability scanning of cloud infrastructure**
   - Providers scan their platforms for vulnerabilities internal to their services and hardware.

2. **Remediate vulnerabilities in infrastructure according to security policies**
   - Providers fix vulnerabilities identified in their infrastructure following industry best practices and security SLAs.

3. **Provide vulnerability scanning capabilities for tenant use**
   - Cloud platforms offer scanning tools or APIs for tenant customers to scan their deployed workloads.

4. **Share relevant vulnerability information with tenants**
   - Providers inform tenant organizations about vulnerabilities impacting the underlying cloud infrastructure.

5. **Maintain secure configuration of cloud infrastructure**
   - Providers ensure that cloud infrastructure defaults and updates comply with secure configuration standards.

## Science Cloud Responsibility

The Science Cloud environment focuses on ongoing vulnerability monitoring and operational coordination.

1. **Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities weekly and when new vulnerabilities are reported**
   - Frequent automated scans ensure up-to-date detection of security issues.

2. **Employ interoperable tools that automate vulnerability management processes**
   - Tools enumerate platforms, detect software flaws, and identify misconfigurations.
   - Tools format checklists, test procedures, and measure impact severity.

3. **Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results**
   - Reports are reviewed to identify true vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation actions.

4. **Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities according to specified timelines**
   - Follow authoritative timelines based on vulnerability severity:
     - KEVs: by due date in CISA catalog
     - Critical: within 15 calendar days
     - High/Important: within 30 calendar days
     - Medium/Moderate: within 30 calendar days
     - Low: within 60 calendar days

5. **Share vulnerability information with designated IT security personnel**
   - Relevant stakeholders are informed for coordinated response.

6. **Employ tools capable of readily updating vulnerabilities to be scanned**
   - Tools maintain current vulnerability databases for accurate detection.

7. **Coordinate activities between NASA and cloud service providers**
   - Regular collaboration ensures aligned remediation and risk management efforts.

## Moderate Tenant Responsibility

Tenants with moderate security requirements play an active role in application-level vulnerability management.

1. **Conduct vulnerability scanning of tenant-specific applications**
   - Tenants scan their custom applications deployed in the cloud.

2. **Remediate vulnerabilities according to NASA timelines**
   - Fix vulnerabilities following NASA-defined deadlines based on severity.

3. **Report significant vulnerabilities to administrators**
   - Critical issues are escalated promptly to NASA or cloud administrators.

4. **Follow Science Cloud vulnerability management procedures**
   - Tenants comply with standardized vulnerability handling policies.

5. **Participate in security assessments and testing activities**
   - Tenants engage in periodic security reviews to validate controls.

6. **Ensure tenant applications remain up-to-date and secure**
   - Tenants manage patches, configurations, and dependencies securely.

## Low Enclave Tenant Responsibility

Tenants in low-impact environments inherit most controls and focus on basic practices.

1. **Follow basic vulnerability management practices**
   - Adhere to minimal scanning, patching, and monitoring.

2. **Address identified vulnerabilities in tenant applications**
   - Remediate any detected application vulnerabilities.

3. **Report security concerns to administrators**
   - Inform administrators of any suspicious findings or incidents.

4. **Comply with Science Cloud vulnerability requirements**
   - Follow the overall vulnerability management framework from Science Cloud.

5. **Understand this control is primarily inherited from Science Cloud**
   - Low tenants primarily rely on Science Cloud and NASA controls for overarching security.
